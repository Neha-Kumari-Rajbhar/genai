# 🤖 Gemini AI ChatBot CLI — Node.js + Google GenAI

A simple and powerful **Command Line Interface (CLI)** chatbot powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, built using **Google's GenAI SDK** and **Node.js**. This project helped me explore how to interact with **large language models (LLMs)** from code and maintain chat history for multi-turn conversations.

 💬 “Type your question, get smart answers — directly from your terminal!”
